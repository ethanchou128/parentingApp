# parentingApp

This is a parenting app which I collaborated with 3 other teammates to create in Android Studio.

The app contains features which would assist parents with managing the everyday life, which included a time-out timer, a random coin-flipper
(to help them make random decisions with regards to their kids, like who gets to choose to eat next), a child database, and a feature designed
to help kids or their parents calm down.

This program was run on emulators/actual Android devices through Android Studio and coded in Java.
